# Overlay-Hijacker
Using process hacker, i noticed that BANDICAM has a "FULLSCREEN" window which has all the properties to be hijacked to render our stuff (esp, wall hacks, etc..). 

This programs scans your computer to find the window, hijacks it, changes its properties, and then returns that window to be used!
